# Full Stack Development Tutorial: PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express & React

This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial for setting up a full-stack application. The tutorial is divided into three main parts: creating a PostgreSQL database, developing a Node.js and Express API, and building a React front-end.

## Part 1: PostgreSQL Database Setup

In the first part, we cover the steps to create a PostgreSQL database using the command line interface (CLI). The database is designed to store books and their corresponding authors.

### Key Concepts:

- Launching PostgreSQL CLI.
- Creating and configuring a database.
- Creating tables for books and authors.
- Establishing relationships between tables.

## Part 2: Node.js and Express API

The second part involves creating a RESTful API using Node.js and Express. This API performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the PostgreSQL database.

### Key Concepts:

- Initializing a Node.js project.
- Setting up Express server.
- Connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
- Defining CRUD API endpoints.

## Part 3: React Front-End Application

The final part of the tutorial focuses on building a React front-end application. This application interacts with the Node.js and Express API to perform CRUD operations through a user interface.

### Key Concepts:

- Creating a React application with Create React App.
- Using Fetch API for HTTP requests.
- Building React components for displaying and managing books.
- Implementing state management and hooks.
